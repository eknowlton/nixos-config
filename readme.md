# NixOS Configuration

I am expirmenting with NixOS and Nix package manager for the first time really.

### Update 8/20/2025

This was a fun expirment. Although after being on NixOS for more than a year as my primary driver, I have decided to move back to either Arch or Ubuntu. 

I love the idea of NixOS and being able to take my config and just run it for a machine, and that honestly seems like it would never work as well as it sounds. With that said; I'm annoyed at the fact that I have to rebuild my system everytime I want to make a change to a small config file, ex: vim. Even with home-manager it's still annoying. 

I think NixOS might be more useful for servers, and I haven't been able to incorporate Nix into any of my production servers because everything is mostly containers these days.

I may use Nix and NixOS synonymous, but they are not. 

## todo

- Seperate packages/services into their own config files 
- Maybe switch to using flakes...
- Document more about which packages and settings
